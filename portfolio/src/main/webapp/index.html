        Now I study in the Computer Architecture Laboratory of Zhejiang University, and I do research projects related to operating systems. The curiosity about how things work within computers puts me on the path to learning computer science, and it's the reason why I'm interested in Systems Programming. I always want to learn new technologies, and solving problems and learning new knowledge can both make me extremely happy.
